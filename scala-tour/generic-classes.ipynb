    "_Note: subtyping of generic types is *invariant*. This means that if we have a stack of characters of type `Stack[Char]` then it cannot be used as an integer stack of type `Stack[Int]`. This would be unsound because it would enable us to enter true integers into the character stack. To conclude, `Stack[A]` is only a subtype of `Stack[B]` if and only if `B = A`. Since this can be quite restrictive, Scala offers a [type parameter annotation mechanism](variances.html) to control the subtyping behavior of generic types._"
