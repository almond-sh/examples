    "[`Any`](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.1/scala/Any.html) is the supertype of all types, also called the top type. It defines certain universal methods such as `equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString`. `Any` has two direct subclasses: `AnyVal` and `AnyRef`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`AnyVal` represents value types. There are nine predefined value types and they are non-nullable: `Double`, `Float`, `Long`, `Int`, `Short`, `Byte`, `Char`, `Unit`, and `Boolean`. `Unit` is a value type which carries no meaningful information. There is exactly one instance of `Unit` which can be declared literally like so: `()`. All functions must return something so sometimes `Unit` is a useful return type.\n",
    "\n",
    "`AnyRef` represents reference types. All non-value types are defined as reference types. Every user-defined type in Scala is a subtype of `AnyRef`. If Scala is used in the context of a Java runtime environment, `AnyRef` corresponds to `java.lang.Object`.\n",

A common use is to signal non-termination such as a thrown exception, program exit, or an infinite loop (i.e., it is the type of an expression which does not evaluate to a value, or a method that does not return normally).\n",
